## Data Preprocessing:

* Encoding(If data in features are categorical):
  + Level Encoder
  + One-Hot Encoder
* Feature Scaling:
  + Standardization
  + Normalization
* Segmentation(divide data between independent variable and dependent variables)
* Split Dataset into Train data and Test data.
* Model Training 
* Performance Metrics of model
* 


## ML Operations:
* Supervised 
  + regression:
    - linear
    - polynomial
  + Classification: 
    - logistic regression
    - Decision tree
    - Random Forest
    - Support Vector Machine
    - K-nearest Neighbour
    - Naive Bayes
    - Gradient Descent
* Unsupervised
  - k-means clustering
  - PCA(When features are large amount)
